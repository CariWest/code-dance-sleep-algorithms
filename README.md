Code, Dance, Sleep is a community dedicated to women and those who identify as women who love coding and dancing.

## Algorithm Practice

This repo is dedicated to algorithm practice for anyone.

## Contributing

1. Monday, an algorithm will be posted in the algorithms folder. It will be labeled as easy, medium, or hard.
2. Take some time during the week to solve the algorithm.
  - *Suggestion:* We always encourage you to write tests for your algorithm.
3. On Friday, push your solution to GitHub and post the link in the #algorithms Slack Channel on Code, Dance, Sleep.
  - Namespace your solution with your GitHub handle so that everyone can push their individual solutions. For example, if the algorithm is named "anagram-detector," the file I would push is "cariwest-anagram-detector".
4. Over the weekend, use GitHub comments to review, critique, praise, and ask questions of other algorithms.
  - Try to review at least one other person's algorithm solution. Aim for a solution which hasn't been reviewed yet, to ensure everyone gets feedback.
  - Remember to contribute constructive feedback in a positive manner. Specificity is highly valued in feedback (i.e., change "This is a terrible solution for O(n)" to "If you reduce the number of each loops in your solution, you'll get a better O(n)." )

## Tips:

Some tips for practicing algorithms in this forum.

  - Aim to get a working solution before you aim to get the best solution. You can always revise later!
  - If you can't solve an algorithm, write comments about where you got stuck. This might help reviewers as they look at your code.
  - You are never required to do the algorithm posted â€” if you would like an easier or a harder challenge, feel free to look at past algorithms. Make sure to post your solution in the Code, Dance, Sleep slack channel so everyone knows to look.

If you would like to suggest a particular algorithm, make a pull request with the algorithm problem in a Readme.
